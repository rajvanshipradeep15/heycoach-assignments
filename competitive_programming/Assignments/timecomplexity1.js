/*
Time Complexity - 1
You are given an integer n. Your task is to simulate the execution of a series of nested loops, where the innermost loop calls a print() function.
You need to determine the total number of times the print() function is executed based on the value of n.

Input Format:

A single integer n.
Output Format:

A single integer representing the number of times the print() function was called. Outer Loop (i-loop):
Initializer: int i = 0, Endpoint: i < n , Increment: i++

First Inner Loop (j-loop):

Initializer: int j = i , Endpoint: j >= 0, Decrement: j--

Second Inner Loop (k-loop): Initializer: int k = i, Endpoint: k >= i - 1, Decrement: k--

During each iteration of the 'k-loop', a function 'print()' is called, which takes constant time O(1) to execute.
Nested Loops Explanation:

Outer Loop (i-loop): Runs from 0 to n-1.
First Inner Loop (j-loop): Starts at i and decrements until 0.
Second Inner Loop (k-loop): Starts at i and decrements until i-1 (runs exactly 2 times for each j).
Sample Input:

3
Sample Output:

12
Explanation:

When n = 3, the loops execute as follows:
For i = 0: j-loop runs 1 time, and each time k-loop runs 2 times (total 2).
For i = 1: j-loop runs 2 times, and each time k-loop runs 2 times (total 4).
For i = 2: j-loop runs 3 times, and each time k-loop runs 2 times (total 6).
Summing up: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 (error in previous manual calculation, it should be 12). Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:

30
Explanation: For n = 5, let's analyze the execution:

Outer Loop (i-loop): Iterates from 0 to 4 (since n = 5).
First Inner Loop (j-loop): Starts at i and decrements down to 0.
Second Inner Loop (k-loop): Starts at i and decrements to i-1. This loop will always execute exactly 2 times for each iteration of the j-loop.
Breakdown by Iterations:

When i = 0:

j iterates from 0 to 0 (1 time).
For each j, k iterates from 0 to -1 (2 times).
Total for i = 0: 1x2= 2 calls to print().
When i = 1:

j iterates from 1 to 0 (2 times).
For each j, k iterates from 1 to 0 (2 times).
Total for i = 1: 2 x 2= 4 calls to print().
When i = 2:

j iterates from 2 to 0 (3 times).
For each j, k iterates from 2 to 1 (2 times).
Total for i = 2: 3*2 = 6 calls to print().
When i = 3:

j iterates from 3 to 0 (4 times).
For each j, k iterates from 3 to 2 (2 times).
Total for i = 3: 4*2 = 8 calls to print().
When i = 4:

j iterates from 4 to 0 (5 times).
For each j, k iterates from 4 to 3 (2 times).
Total for i = 4: 5*2 = 10 calls to print().
Calculation for n = 5: Adding all these together:

2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
Therefore, when the input n is 5, the print() function is called a total of 30 times.

Note:
The function should update class member variables as required, without returning or printing results.
